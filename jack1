After graduating with a bachelors in CST from the university of Buea, I was fortunate to be employed in the IT field which helped me expand my knowledge in cloud and general IT concepts. This way, I was able to provide training to students and some staff members. With the love I have for learning and growing in the tech field, I move to work as a project manager after 5 years.
